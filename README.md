Materials for Pteropod time series analysis

## Summary

The relevant raw datasets are as follows: 

* `WOAC_data_5-1-2018_for_Nina.xlsx` CTD casts by cruise id, date, and depth, include several water chemistry and physical variables

* `WOAC_PT_summary_combined_years_bio data.xlsx` Pteropod biological data seven stations, eight dates (~ three months in three years), includes several scarring metrics

* `abundances_bio data.xlsx` Pteropod biological data at seven stations, only two months in one year, abundances only (individuals per unit volume)

## To do

* Environmental and biological data were collected at separate locations, data must be aggregated by linking those closest in date/time, environmental observations to be integrated to a depth of 100m

* __Big question__: What drives Pteropod biological response over time in the Puget sound?

     * Spatial variation?
     * Annual or seasonal variation?
     * Which OA parameters?
     * What characteristics of the OA parameters (min, ave, max)?
