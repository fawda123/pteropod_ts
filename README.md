## Summary

The relevant raw datasets are as follows: 

* `WOAC_allData_DS_forNina_nb.xlsx` pteropod biology and chemistry data

Processed data:

* `biodat.RData` processed biology data, only dissolution types as percentage of individuals were kept, abundances as no of inds/m3, average and standard deviation of sizes also retained

* `chmdat.RData` processed chemistry data, pCO2 is uatm, all other variables are umol/kg
